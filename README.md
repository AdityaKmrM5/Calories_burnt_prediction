# Calorie Burn Prediction App

This is a simple web app that predicts how many calories a person burns during a workout.  
It uses a machine learning model trained on exercise and health data.

The user enters details like age, gender, height, weight, workout time, heart rate and the app shows the estimated calories burned along with BMI.

The app is built using Python, XGBoost and Streamlit, and it is deployed using Streamlit Cloud.
